This project was built using python. I built this project to understand the basics of CNN and image processing and to demonstrate the findings i built a tkinter user interface and below are the sceenshots shared. 
For model selection i trained multiple CNN architectures like VGG16 , VGG19, Rsenet50 , and Densenet121 . The Densenet121 was the best model which demonstrated high accuracy and high f1 score so i saved it and tested on real world data and it outperformed all the other models so i saved it and used it in the project.

## Project UI

Here is the example usage of the project
